# Interview-bound
# To Sam and Bound-Touch
First of all I want to thank you for this opportunity, I had learned a lot. I spent a total of 15h doing this challenge and I would say about 75% of my time was learning and planning which was what I considered the must difficult part of the project. I 
want you to know that I know this is not very well documented becaused I normally only do personal projects or university projects which normally do not require a very well documented scripts, I did my best anyways. Furthermore I also know that there are parts of the scripts that do not follow the best programming practices like for example the test file and I think the response 200 from /track... should be programmed with a response class or something different.Finally I am not sure if I would use Jupyter notebook in production, but for this challenge it seem very helpfull once I was able to test code and create the scripts all in the same place. So as I said I know some things are not good but I gave my best. I hope you liked
