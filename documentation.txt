## Documentantion

## Reporting_notebook - this jupyter notebook as all the functions written and can be used to change the code.
## Note: if you are not planning to use it to edit code it may be a good ideia to erase it or change the functions name in order to not overwrite functions


-----------Flask Server and Amazon Architecture----------
## main.py is the script that runs the flask server and put the records, from flask actions, to the amazon firehose

## Firehose - Delivery Streams
For each action was created a Delivery Stream in order to separate the data and writed in different preffixes in the amazon S3

4 where created
projectx_del - for testing and exploring
projectx-track - for keep the records from the track action in the http server
projectx-alias - for keep the records from the track action in the http server
projectx-profile - for keep the records from the track action in the http server


## Amazon S3
projectxS3 - is the bucker where our data will be stored
It as 3 preffixes corresponding to the data send from the different "Flask Actions" in each year. Once we have 3 "flask Actions" and only one logs from one year we will have:
track2019 - to store the data from /track requests from the year 2019
alias2019 - to store the data from /alias requests from the year 2019
profile2019 - to store the data from /profile requests from the year 2019

------------Test Function----------------
## test.py is a script that test the responses of this http server to some scenarios

------------locust function--------------
## locust.py runs locust with the configuration of this API in localhost 8089
